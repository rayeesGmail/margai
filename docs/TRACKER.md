D4 · 2026-09-06 · PHASE 0 — Foundations
Shipped (branch d4-core-schema, 8 commits): V1 extensions (vector, pg_trgm), V2 identity (users,
  student_profiles), V3 curriculum_core (syllabus_nodes, syllabus_prerequisites, archetype_tracks,
  archetype_track_steps, cutoffs), V4 chapter_status — column-complete per TECH_PLAN §2.2–§2.4,
  VARCHAR + CHECK enumerations, ON DELETE RESTRICT, named constraints/indexes, a -- ROLLBACK: …
  -- END ROLLBACK block in every header. Drafted by the db-migrator agent in one call and reviewed
  column by column; no rewrite was needed. db/seed/R__test_taxonomy.sql (2 subjects, 2 units,
  6 chapters, 2 topics, 4 prerequisite edges, one dropper track with 7 steps, 3 synthetic cutoffs;
  fixed UUIDs, idempotent upserts) behind the local and test profiles; ./mvnw spring-boot:run
  activates local via the Maven plugin. Eight JPA entities + Spring Data repositories in the
  account/curriculum/practice internal packages, shared value enums (AttemptType, Category) in
  common.api; lowercase enum constants = DB/wire codes. Spring Modulith 2.1.1 with per-module
  allowedDependencies (§1.4) + ModularityTest; TestcontainersConfiguration (one container per JVM,
  one database per active-profile set); MigrationReversibilityTest (§8.2; also rejects PostgreSQL
  enum types, D3.5); SeedTaxonomyTest (graph acyclic); three @DataJpaTest constraint slices; the
  boot test now proves ddl-auto: validate for every entity and seed absence without a profile.
  30 tests in 7 classes; a full ./mvnw verify takes ≈7 s warm on this Mac (one shared container).
  Rule edits per §0.2 (server.md, db-migrator.md incl. the enum-line fix),
  9 DECISIONS rows, server README + db/migration README rewritten.
Acceptance: PASS —
  (a) "schema matches approved plan": validate green for all eight entities in every Spring test;
      compose db after spring-boot:run (local): flyway_schema_history V1–V4 + R test taxonomy,
      8 tables, extensions vector + pg_trgm; information_schema/pg_constraint/pg_indexes dump
      compared line by line with §2.2–§2.4 — every column, type, default, CHECK list, partial
      unique, foreign key and index present. Additions beyond the plan text, all harmless:
      syllabus_nodes class_level CHECK (11|12), cutoffs_category_check,
      syllabus_prerequisites_to_node_id_idx.
  (b) "migrations reversible": MigrationReversibilityTest — empty database → V1–V4 → rollback
      blocks newest first → only flyway_schema_history remains, only plpgsql among extensions,
      no sequences/views. Green.
  spec-auditor on the branch diff: PASS, 3 minor findings, all fixed before the close —
  (1) the seed upserted ON CONFLICT (code) while rows carry fixed ids, so editing a code would
  have broken re-application → upserts now key on the id, seed's unexecuted rollback block
  removed, DECISIONS row and db-migrator.md reworded — proven on the compose db, which already
  held the old seed: the changed checksum re-ran the repeatable migration through the id-keyed
  upserts (second "test taxonomy" history row, still 12 nodes / 7 steps); (2) MigrationReversibilityTest split undo
  SQL on ';' although the convention says one statement per line → header blocks run line by
  line, U-files are handed to the driver whole; (3) five constraints had no slice test
  (class_level CHECK, prerequisite and step foreign keys, unique track code, chapter_status node
  FK) → seven tests added, one violation each (a second violation in the same test only sees
  "current transaction is aborted"); 30 tests in 7 classes.
Founder decisions: the plan was approved as written; its four closing questions were answered
  with the recommended option each — scope incl. chapter_status, lowercase enum codes,
  db-migrator drafts the DDL, all four rule-edit lines.
Doc conflicts surfaced in the plan (none blocked): db-migrator.md still allowed PostgreSQL enum
  types vs D3.5 (fixed today); DEV_SPEC §3 vs TECH_PLAN §2 column differences (TECH_PLAN wins by
  §0.3, no action); PLAN D4 one-liner vs TECH_PLAN §2.9 adding chapter_status (in scope).
Deviation from the approved plan, recorded: the `common` module exists from D4, not D5 —
  AttemptType and Category are stored by both account and curriculum, which §1.4 forbids from
  depending on each other; DECISIONS row. ArchUnit still waits for D5 (DECISIONS row).
Parked: none new.
Surprise: (1) Spring Boot stops a @ServiceConnection container bean whenever a context closes —
  including one that failed to start — so the shared-container pattern must keep the container
  outside Spring's lifecycle (DynamicPropertyRegistrar). (2) Contexts with different Flyway
  locations cannot share one database: the test profile's applied R__ migration fails validation
  in a no-profile context → one database per active-profile set inside the container.
  (3) PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver throws on a `classpath:` root that does not exist yet
  (db/rollback/); `classpath*:` tolerates it. (4) Hibernate 7.4 validated every mapping first time:
  Instant ↔ TIMESTAMPTZ, CHAR(2) via @JdbcTypeCode(CHAR), JSONB as String, TIME ↔ LocalTime,
  a record as @EmbeddedId. (5) Modulith 2.x has getIdentifier(), not getName(), on ApplicationModule.
PR #3 from d4-core-schema merged to main by the founder 2026-09-06 (merge commit 3f77d6f) — the
  first CI run that downloads Spring Modulith and runs the Testcontainers suite on a GitHub
  runner; CI green (founder-verified 2026-09-06).
Tomorrow's first task: D5 from TECH_PLAN §4.1 (AiClient v2 + FakeAiClient +
  decorator chain), §4.8 ledger and breaker, §2.8 ai_calls as V5 (append-only: no updated_at),
  §1.2 bedrock profile, the D5 rule edit (§0.2: ai-layer.md RouteDecision wording), ArchUnit's
  first rule (only ai imports the Bedrock SDK), and the one live smoke call — which needs console
  checks #1, #2, #4 closed by the founder first.
```

```
D3 · 2026-09-03/04 · PHASE 0 — Foundations
Shipped (branch d3-tech-plan, 10 commits): docs/TECH_PLAN.md — Technical Plan v1.0, ≈1,950 lines.
  §0 precedence, DEV_SPEC §2–12 disposition table, nine surfaced conflicts/gaps. §1 modular monolith:
  17 modules with owned tables and an acyclic dependency graph, run modes as Spring profiles, request
  lifecycle, nightly execution, cross-module events. §2 data model: ≈45 tables, the D4 slice column-
  complete, one Flyway migration per PLAN day (V1–V31), retention and deletion. §3 API: token model,
  envelope + code catalog, rate limits, idempotency, polling until D69, every endpoint with its PLAN
  day and shape. §4 AI: AiClient v2 (two primitives + decorator chain), RouteDecision for REASON, the
  11-stage doubt pipeline with the enforcement point of each hard rule, limits and fair use, nightly
  planner with deterministic candidates and fallback, classification, SRS variants, ledger and
  breaker, hybrid retrieval, two-layer eval harness, Bedrock specifics, prompts, hard-rule map. §5
  Flutter: layers, Riverpod without codegen, go_router, dio, Hinglish as hi_Latn, drift outbox with
  the offline-verdict options. §6 content pipeline: Java module under the pipeline profile, VISION
  extraction, commands mapped to D13–D23. §7 AWS beta stack, SSM layout, IAM, backups, F8 timeline,
  cost. §8–§11 testing, security/DPDP, observability, conventions. §12 PLAN mapping and gaps. §13
  risks, console checks, single-instance assumptions, eight founder decisions. §14 25 decisions for
  DECISIONS.md.
Acceptance: PASS — TECH_PLAN v1.0 APPROVED by the founder 2026-09-04 (status line flipped, commit
  on d3-tech-plan). spec-auditor: pass 1 FAIL (1 blocker: the correct_key rule had been silently
  narrowed; 5 major; ~15 minor), pass 2 FAIL (2 major; ~20 minor), pass 3 PASS (14 minor wording
  items, all folded in). Three rounds, ≈60 findings addressed.
Founder decisions at approval (TECH_PLAN §0.5), one line each:
  1a correct_key reading ACCEPTED — never sent before that student's answer is recorded server-side;
     CLAUDE.md rule 1, server.md, endpoint.md, spec-auditor.md and PLAN D31 ✅ reworded today.
  1b Offline verdicts: OPTION A — pack carries judging data for the student's own day only,
     obfuscated (best effort), wiped after sync; server re-judging authoritative; D34 adds the
     clause + the only-pre-answer-carrier test.
  2  Mocks SCHEDULED at D35 (kind=mock), autopsy in D54's buffer; slips to the slippage log.
  3  Batch sync: self-report at D25, timetable doc_type at D29; weekly confirm card PARKED.
  4  PostHog error tracking ACCEPTED within the three-SDK rule; revisit D73.
  5  F8 infra workstream ACCEPTED (§7.6 timeline); Terraform drafted in a separate infra session
     profile (plan allowed, apply denied) created when the first milestone is due; founder applies.
  6  Java pipeline CONFIRMED with the D14 escape hatch.
  7  Founder runs the four console checks before D5; PG17 fallback is a versions change (touch
     points listed in TECH_PLAN §13.2, incl. SPEC §3).
  8  Minors: consent OTP inside the onboarding flow; until consent, CONSENT_REQUIRED covers photo
     doubts and documents (text stays available) — decision D3.28.
Post-approval exchange (three readings surfaced before executing, all ruled by the founder):
  decision 8 reading ACCEPTED with two tightenings — consent OTP fired at the DOB step, "consent
  pending" state on Profile + re-prompt at gated moments; legal review = workstream F9, not a
  blocker. DEV_SPEC §13.2 divergence ACCEPTED as handled (live CLAUDE.md wins; note records it).
  PG17 fallback protocol: SPEC §3 is amended only by the founder, or by Claude on an explicit
  per-edit instruction, with a DECISIONS.md row citing the console finding; contract edits are never
  bundled into task work — now a CLAUDE.md session rule. If PG18 is on RDS Mumbai the branch evaporates.
Conflict resolutions recorded (TECH_PLAN §0.4): #1 infra day → F8; #2 batch inference conditional on
  the minimum, on-demand below it; #3 eval gate = founder-launched live run + committed stamp, CI
  verifies the stamp and runs the fake layer (D23); #4 correct_key per decisions 1a/1b; #5 pipeline in
  Java; #6 streaming at D69; #7 five unscheduled features per decisions 2–3 (seed generation, trap
  mining, continuity still unscheduled); #8 CLAUDE.md precedence line added; #9 rule rewordings on
  their days (D4, D5, D13). DEV_SPEC §13.2 keeps the original hard-rule sentence; CLAUDE.md's note
  records the divergence (D1 precedent).
Doc conflicts surfaced (TECH_PLAN §0.4): PLAN has no infrastructure day (→ proposed F8); Bedrock
  batch-inference minimum vs "all nightly calls batch"; the eval gate cannot run live in CI; the
  correct_key wording vs SPEC §6.2/§6.4 verdicts (online reading proposed for approval; offline
  Option A/B open); pipeline module placement vs pipeline.md; streaming at D69 by PLAN precedence;
  five SPEC features with no PLAN day (batch sync, seed generation, trap mining, mocks + autopsy,
  continuity re-onboarding); CLAUDE.md precedence slot; three rule sentences to reword on their days.
Verified: Flutter gen-l10n accepts app_hi_Latn.arb (scratch project, Flutter 3.47.2) — Hinglish needs
  no custom plumbing.
Parked: see PARKED (uuidv7, ai_calls partitioning, staging env, golden tests, Crashlytics fallback,
  auto-deploy on main, second-instance upgrades).
Surprise: the plan came out at ≈1,950 lines against a 900–1,200 estimate; the schema and endpoint
  catalogs are the bulk. The spec-auditor's first pass caught a hard rule being narrowed without a
  §0.4 entry — keep the audit-before-handover habit for design documents, not just code.
Tomorrow's first task: founder pushes d3-tech-plan and opens PR #2 (CI: guardrails + secret scan
  only matter for docs). Then D4 core schema straight from TECH_PLAN §2.2–§2.4 and §2.9 (V1–V4 +
  the db/seed test taxonomy), the reversibility test (§8.2) and the first Modulith boundary test
  (§8.1), plus the D4 rule edit from §0.2 (append-only tables carry no updated_at).
Console check #3 closed (2026-09-04, after PR #2 merged): PG 18.6 + t4g.small + pgvector 0.8.1
  confirmed; checks #1, #2, #4 (Bedrock models/IDs, batch minimum, embeddings access) still
  pending before D5. Recorded in DECISIONS.md (D4 row), TECH_PLAN §13.2 item 3 and the new
  docs/runbooks/f8-infrastructure.md smoke stub; the PG17 fallback was never applied.
```

  pull 29 s, Maven deps ≈1.5 min → ≈14.5 min end to end on this connection, inside the bound.
  Shell runs on the Android 36 emulator (screenshot: "MARG AI"; com.margai.app resumed).
  spec-auditor on the full diff: PASS, one minor finding (a document conflict logged in
  DECISIONS.md) fixed by moving it here; jq added to the Brewfile on its advice (hooks need it).
  CI: PR #1 from d2-local-env green (founder-verified 2026-09-03) — first real run of the server
  and app jobs; merged to main by the founder (merge commit 5e97f35).
Doc conflict surfaced: DEV_SPEC §13.8 (bootstrap prompt) scaffolds server/ with "first migration
  = users + subscriptions"; PLAN D2 is environment only and PLAN D4 owns the first migrations
  (docker-compose.yml already says so). Resolved by PLAN precedence in the approved D2 plan;
  DEV_SPEC §13.8 stays as the historical bootstrap text. D3 design item: Hinglish is not a
  BCP-47 locale, so the ARB strategy for the third language needs a decision.
Parked: Android CLI migration (sdkmanager deprecated); libpq so `psql -h localhost` works;
  gh CLI in the Brewfile; Gradle native-access flag on JDK 25.
Surprise: Testcontainers 2.x renamed its artifacts (testcontainers-postgresql, package
  org.testcontainers.postgresql). Homebrew `openjdk` 25.0.2 was already installed but invisible
  to java_home — that is why D1 saw "JDK 21"; a user-level symlink fixes it without sudo.
  Gradle 9.3.1 / AGP 9.1 build on JDK 25, so one JDK suffices (no flutter --jdk-dir).
  flutter create's Kotlin template carries TODO comments that the gate rejects — removed.
  Another project's Keycloak holds 127.0.0.1:8080 on this Mac; SERVER_PORT=8081 works (README).
  psql is not installed although settings allow it — use `docker compose exec -T db psql`.
Tomorrow's first task: D3 — the full technical plan from SPEC (architecture, data model, API
  surface, AI pipeline) for a whole-session review; decide the Hinglish ARB locale strategy in it.
```

```
D1 · 2026-09-02 · PHASE 0 — Foundations
Shipped: git repo on main (6 commits). docs renamed to SPEC / DEV_SPEC / PLAN / TRACKER.
  CLAUDE.md (DEV_SPEC §13.2 verbatim + precedence + session rules). .claude/settings.json
  (permissions + hooks). scripts/precommit-gate.sh, block-paths.sh, detect-secrets.sh.
  eval/run.sh placeholder with content-hash stamp. Rules ×4, agents ×2 (spec-auditor,
  db-migrator), commands ×3 (/week, /endpoint, /evalgate). docker-compose db
  (pgvector pg18). GitHub Actions CI (guardrails, server, app, eval). Skeleton READMEs.
Acceptance: PASS —
  (a) commit with a todo-marker file + an unstamped prompts/ change → BLOCKED (both
      reasons listed); after eval/run.sh the same change passes the gate.
  (b) fake AWS access key via the Write tool → BLOCKED; via a shell heredoc → BLOCKED.
  (c) Write to infra/prod/main.tf → BLOCKED by hook; Write to the dotenv file → refused
      by the permission deny rule before the hook ran.
  (d) `aws s3 ls` → PERMISSION DENIED (aws CLI is installed locally, so a real test).
  (e) five clean commits passed through the live gate.
Parked: git-native pre-commit hook; protect scripts/ + settings.json from agent edits;
  release-checklist skill (DEV_SPEC §13.1).
Surprise: DEV_SPEC §13.3 is not valid settings JSON (comments, matcher form,
  PostToolUse cannot block) — translated, rationale in commit ddb25ac. Bash bypasses the
  Write/Edit hooks, so the hooks now cover Bash too; side effect: any shell command that
  merely mentions a protected path is blocked (lone `git commit`/`git log` exempted).
  CLAUDE.md §13.2 "SPEC §3–5" citations pointed at Developer-Spec sections; now read DEV_SPEC.
Tomorrow's first task: D2 — install Flutter stable and JDK 25 (local is 21), then the
  Spring Boot 4 skeleton with ./mvnw so the gate's SKIPPED warnings disappear.

## 🅿️ PARKED (Sunday review only)

- _idea · date · one line_
- git-native pre-commit hook (`core.hooksPath` → scripts/precommit-gate.sh) · 2026-09-02 · today only Claude's commits are gated; the human's own commits bypass the gate
- protect scripts/ and .claude/settings.json from agent edits after D1 · 2026-09-02 · the policed agent can currently edit its own policy; commit review by the human is the only control
- `.claude/skills/release-checklist/` (DEV_SPEC §13.1: migration check, eval gate, changelog) · 2026-09-02 · not in D1 scope; needed before Week 11 (money) at the latest
- migrate scripts/dev-setup.sh from `sdkmanager` to the new Android CLI · 2026-09-03 · sdkmanager prints a deprecation notice; still works
- `brew "libpq"` so the allowed `psql -h localhost *` command exists locally · 2026-09-03 · today sessions use `docker compose exec -T db psql`
- `brew "gh"` so sessions can read CI run status after the human pushes · 2026-09-03 · optional; web UI works
- silence Gradle's JDK 25 native-access warning (`--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` in gradle.properties) · 2026-09-03 · cosmetic
- `uuidv7()` primary keys (native in PostgreSQL 18) for append-only tables · 2026-09-04 · better index locality on `practice_events`/`ai_calls`; irrelevant at beta volume (TECH_PLAN D3.11)
- month partitioning of `ai_calls` and `practice_events` · 2026-09-04 · when volume asks for it (TECH_PLAN §2.8)
- a staging environment between local and beta · 2026-09-04 · not before public launch (TECH_PLAN §7.1)
- Flutter golden tests · 2026-09-04 · widget tests per state suffice for now (TECH_PLAN §8.4)
- Crashlytics if PostHog error tracking proves insufficient on Android · 2026-09-04 · would amend the three-SDK rule (TECH_PLAN §13.4)
- automatic deploy on merge to main · 2026-09-04 · manual `workflow_dispatch` until D72 (TECH_PLAN §7.4)
- second-API-task upgrades: Valkey-backed rate limits, ShedLock for the dispatcher, SQS for async listeners · 2026-09-04 · only when a second task exists (TECH_PLAN §13.3)
- weekly batch-confirm card ("Did your batch finish Rotational Motion?", SPEC §6.7 layer 4) · 2026-09-04 · founder decision 3 at D3: parked until the beta contains coaching students; self-report (D25) and timetable photo (D29) are scheduled
- Cohere Rerank 3.5 (Mumbai on-demand, $2 per 1,000 queries of ≤100 chunks) as a rerank stage after hybrid retrieval fusion (TECH_PLAN §4.9) · 2026-09-06 · seen on the pricing page during console check #4; only if the D17 ✅ 15-query check or the D23 eval shows fusion alone missing the right paragraphs
- continuity re-onboarding after a result that falls short (SPEC §7.2 Fork B) and NCERT-style seed generation to ≥30 questions/topic (SPEC §9.3), NTA-trap mining (SPEC §9.4) · 2026-09-04 · unscheduled per TECH_PLAN §12.2; seed generation and trap mining proposed for the D24 buffer
